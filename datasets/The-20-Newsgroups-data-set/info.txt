The 20 Newsgroups data set

The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. To the best of my knowledge, it was originally collected by Ken Lang, probably for his Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews paper, though he does not explicitly mention this collection. The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering.


1. 20news-19997.tar.gz - Original 20 Newsgroups data set
2. 20news-bydate.tar.gz - 20 Newsgroups sorted by date; duplicates and some headers removed (18846 documents)
3. 20news-18828.tar.gz - 20 Newsgroups; duplicates removed, only "From" and "Subject" headers (18828 documents)


I recommend the "bydate" version since cross-experiment comparison is easier (no randomness in train/test set selection), newsgroup-identifying information has been removed and it's more realistic because the train and test sets are separated in time.
[7/3/07] I had originally listed the bydate version as containing 18941 documents. I've discovered that the correct count is 18846, of which rainbow skips 22. So the matlab version (below) represents 18824 documents. However, my rainbow2matlab.py script drops empty and single-word documents, of which there are 50 post-rainbow-processing, so you will find only 18774 total entries in the matlab/octave version.

You'll find six files:
train.data
train.label
train.map
test.data
test.label
test.map

The .data files are formatted "docIdx wordIdx count". The .label files are simply a list of label id's. The .map files map from label id's to label names. Rainbow was used to lex the data files. I used the following two scripts to produce the data files:
5a. lexData.sh
5b. rainbow2matlab.py

[Added 1/14/08] The following file contains the vocabulary for the indexed data. The line number corresponds to the index number of the word---word on the first line is word #1, word on the second line is word #2, etc.
